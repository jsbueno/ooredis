OORedis - Pythonic access to Redis/Valkey/eloqkv
================================================


Somewhat straightforward Python ABC mapping
over basic Redis data structures, allowing multiple
instances of a running program (including multiprocesses and
instances across container nodes) to read and write to 
those as they would over native Python dicts and lists


## Work in progress
A basic RedisDict implementation is present
in this commit
